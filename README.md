# SHHS-Band-Website-Awasome
When we first started, we wanted to make an awesome calendar. Therefore, we spent weeks making a javascript calendar. However, we were novices in the art of javascript. Which led to us looking up how to create a calendar, and we found one. The code was old, so we used our Dev Catalyst lessons to fix the code. It worked on our computers, but it did not work for Christen Harper who we had a google meet with. In result, we changed the calendar last minute in hope of that the calendar would show up. The calendar that we replaced it with is not nearly as interactive as the calendar we had before. We apologize for last minute calendar shift, and we hope that you enjoy our beautiful kitty-cat band. Not to include, we lost more time than expected thanks to Covid-19. In conclusion, we had fun but experienced tons of unexpected difficulties.
