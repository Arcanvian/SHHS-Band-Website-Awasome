        <p>     The band is what you would expect a band to be, except it is much larger than a normal band.
            It allows you to explore your musical prowess, mostly instruments of course.
            Along with this it is a club for your interests, and helps
            you to find others who share your interests.

                Mr.Ashby's story
            </h1>
            <p class="Ashby-Story">I am Jordan Ashby the Director of Bands and Choir at Scotts Hill High School.
                 I hold a Baccalaureate of Music Education from Murray State University. 
                 My experiences in music span 17 years and have led me to perform nationally with the Trumpet Ensembles of Murray State University at the National Trumpet Competition.
                  I also perform locally and professionally for churches, weddings, and other community ensembles in the Jackson, TN, Memphis, TN, and Murray, KY areas. My experiences have also led me to teach Marching Band, Concert Band, Choir, and other smaller Chamber Ensembles while in college and through summer programs. 

                I am a certified music educator in the State of Tennessee with memberships through the National Association for Music Edcuation (NAfME), the West Tennessee Band and Orchestra Administration (WTSBOA), and the Tennessee chapter of NAfME (TnMEA). I currently teach Choir, Marching Band, Jazz Band, Percussion Ensemble, and Concert band at Scotts Hill High School as well as Middle School Band at Scotts Hill Elementary School. 
                
                Through music I hope to cultivate, inspire, and lead students to successful futures. Through music and grit we learn leadership, responsibility, team work, cohesion, and a world language that is useful and practical in all walks of life. Music is a cultural phenomenon that holds together the fabric of society through life experiences through the good and bad times. We learn to grow together and become stewards for life beyond school and the work place with music. My goal is that students learn these traits and inspire others from their hard work and determination through their musical experiences.
